Backup:
This package at each run remove previous installed FakeSMC.kext and PlugIns (also from other projects):
FakeSMC.kext
ADT7470.kext
Andigilog.kext
ACPIMonitor.kext
ACPISensors.kext
AmdCPUMonitor.kext
CPUSensors.kext
DIMMSensor.kext
F718x.kext
GeforceSensor.kext
GPUSensors.kext
HWInfo.kext
ICHSBus.kext
IntelCPUMonitor.kext
ITEIT87x.kext

NVClockX.kext
PC8739x.kext
RadeonMonitor.kext
SMIMonitor.kext
VoodooBatterySMC.kext
W836x.kext
X3100.kext

These kexts are searched in all subdirectories of /S/L/E (or EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other if that is selected)
and moved to a backup folder in the root of the target Volume. New ones are copied inside the new FakeSMC.kext/Contents/PlugIns/, for this you will see only the FakeSMC.kext!";
